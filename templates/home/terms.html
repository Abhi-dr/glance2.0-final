            <h2>Eligibility</h2>
            <p>Participation is open exclusively to current GLA University students who maintain good academic standing and possess valid work authorization in India.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Registration</h2>
            <p>Participants must pre-register online with accurate details. Providing false information may lead to disqualification.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Application Process</h2>
            <p>The number of companies a student can apply to per day depends on various factors, including the company's interview mode (offline/hybrid), last-minute schedule changes; whether the student is part of the Alumni Affairs team or not. Early registration is highly encouraged, as late applications may only be considered under special circumstances. Submitting your application before the deadline greatly enhances your chances of securing an interview.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Entry Requirements</h2>
            <p>Attendees must present a valid college ID or government-issued ID (e.g., Aadhaar Card). Participants must adhere to a professional dress code. Participants must report at least 15 minutes before their scheduled interview or session. Professional behaviour is expected throughout the Fair. Any form of misconduct, unprofessional behavior, or violation of university ethics may lead to immediate disqualification.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Interview & Selection</h2>
            <p>Companies will select candidates based on their own selection criteria. Although the Department of Alumni Affairs supports the Fair, it does not participate in the selection process. Participation in interviews and job offers are solely at the discretion of the company and the student.</p>
            <p>Efforts will be made to reschedule conflicting interviews in the last available slot, however, this cannot be guaranteed due to limited influence over company schedules. If a company conducts virtual interviews, students must ensure a stable internet connection and a quiet environment to avoid disruptions. Students should ensure that their laptop/mobile device is fully charged and have backup power in case of a virtual interview.</p>

If a student registers but fails to attend the Fair, they may be blacklisted from all future placement opportunities, either through the Alumni Association or the University, depending on the circumstances and at the discretion of the administration.</p>
            <p>If a student misses an interview or an assigned day for which they registered, they may be blacklisted from all future placement activities, subject to review on a case-by-case basis.</p>
